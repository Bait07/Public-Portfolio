Typography:
- Use Inter for headings and body.
- Keep typography scale consistent (H1/H2/H3/body/small).

Color/themes:
- Implement theming with CSS variables on :root using data-theme="dark|light".
- Dark is primary; light is supported.
- Ensure contrast and readability.

Liquid glass:
- Implement glassmorphism via pure CSS using backdrop-filter blur + rgba background + subtle border + shadow.
- Create reusable className: "liquid-glass" (or component <Glass/> wrapper).
- Provide hover and active states.

Layout:
- Max container 1200px, center aligned.
- 8px spacing scale.
- Bottom nav fixed with safe-area padding; avoid overlap with content.
